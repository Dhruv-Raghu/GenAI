# GettingFamiliarWithAmazonBedrock
Series of projects to get myself familiar with Amazon Bedrock and AWS.

## Prerequisites
- [x] Install and configure the AWS CLI (https://tinyurl.com/2b63f584)
- [x] Install boto3
- [x] Langchain_aws (optional package that integrates LLM features with AWS services. Documentation is messy, might be better to stick with using boto3 since the functionality that langchain provides can still be achieved without the package)
- [x] Streamlit (for the web app)

## 1. Text Generation
Learn how to use Amazon Bedrock to generate responses to basic prompts.
### Learning Outcomes
- Use boto3 to create the bedrock client.
- Configure the model and its paramters.
- Use langchain_aws to invoke responses.
- Create a bot that can translate user text from english to French, Spanish or Italian.
- Create a working GUI for the translator using Streamlit.

## 2. Knowledge Bases and RAG
Work in progress..
